# Psychrometric Chart

View the live chart at: https://xclipseinc.github.io/psychrometric/index.html

Goals of this psychrometric chart:

- Open source and accessible online.
- Dynamic and adjustable parameters for chart construction.
- High-quality visualization and exports (SVG and PNG).
- Lightweight page load. No unwanted ads or fluff.
- Just static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, no need to have an internet
  connection, just a web browser.

## Technologies used

* Chart is created using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* Front-end framework: [knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com)
* [SaveSvgAsPng](https://github.com/exupero/saveSvgAsPng)
* Nothing else!

## Still to do:

- [ ] Tableau Extension Connector.
- [ ] Show other calculated psychrometric properties for states.
- [ ] Use other properties besides humidity ratio for fixing states.
- [ ] User-defined color schemes.
